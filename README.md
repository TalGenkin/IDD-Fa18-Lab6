# ChatBot

*A lab report by Tal Genkin*

## In this Report

To submit your lab, fork [this repository](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/IDD-Fa18-Lab6). You'll need to upload any code you change into your fork, as well as upload a video of a friend or classmate using your chatbot.

## Make the ChatBot your own

I change the questions to be trivia questions. The user gets three questions: what is the capital of spain, how much is 2 in the power of 1024 and in what year was the airplane invented. If the user answers correctly, s/he gets a message that the answer was correct, and otherwise, that the answer wasn't correct, and gets the correct answer. I did leave the font change at the end and just changed the quetion.

[The code](chatServer.js)

## Record someone trying out your ChatBot
